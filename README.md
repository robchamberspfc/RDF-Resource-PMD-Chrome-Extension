# PMD SPARQL results dereference tool (Chrome Extension)

A Chrome extension designed to allow selection of a URI in [PublishMydata](https://www.swirrl.com/) (PMD) and dereference that resource in a new tab.

**This is an unpacked extension so you will need to have 'Extensions' set to 'developer mode to load.**

## Instructions for adding

Go to `chrome://extensions/`
Click `Load unpacked extensions`
Select this directory

Highlight the URI you want and click the button and a new tab will open with on the resources page for that URI.
